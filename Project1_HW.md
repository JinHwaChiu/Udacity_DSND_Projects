## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, there are questions I wnat to explore in stackoverflow survet at 2021   
1. What is population of codeing language at 2021 ?
2. How well can we predict the the frequency of visiting Stack Overflow? What variables correlate well with the frequency of visiting Stack Overflow ? 
3. How well can we predict the the frequency of participation in Q&amp;A on Stack Overflow?(ask, answer, vote for, or comment on questions.) What variables correlate well with the frequency of participation ?   


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available to demonstrate the analysis results for above questions.  In notebooks,  there are markdown cells, comment notes in code cells to assist reviewer to understand my thought process for each code cell.  
  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
Please see my blog post at [here](https://medium.com/@jkmemo2013/how-often-do-you-visit-the-stackoverflow-ff396221b0cb)
For Q1, we can see the first three development types are full-stack, back-end, front-end
With only the chart of Language Have Worked With we can't tell what developer types are dominating numbers in our survey, each person with a specific development type could have mulitple language skills, like: Person A with back-end developer may have javascript, HTML/CSS skill too. However, with the chart of development type. we can say full-stack is our first dominating developer types in our survey population

For Q2,3, although the compensation frequency appears to be one of the top indicators for both the frequency of visiting and the frequency of articipan; However, comparing to coefficient ranking btw Q2 and Q3 results, we can see that people have employment in organization have higher participant.
